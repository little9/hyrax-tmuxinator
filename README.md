# hyrax-tmuxinator
tmuxinator configs for running Hyrax development environments

This repo contains YAML files that are used with [tumxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) to run Hyrax development 
environments. 

Each of them corresponds to a Hyrax project that was worked on by [DCE](https://github.com/curationexperts). They won't work unless the dependencies for the project have 
been installed and an appropriate rvm gemset has been created. 

The repo is mainly so I can keep track of these configurations and how they change over time, but may be useful for seeing 
how a particular project is setup since the file should run everything necessary for the development and testing environments.
